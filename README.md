# Big Hearts Dog Rescue

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project. This is a redone version of an earlier project of mine that includes the fixes I noted for further development as well as some new features and general retidying.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript
- React

### Continued development
I would love for this to use a pet adoption site's API, but all of the options I looked at no longer offer keys or only offer keys to registered rescues. I also would love to build the feature section to randomly display animals, but I ran out of time to add a working version of that.
